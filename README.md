## My process

"In summary, I started by installing, applying, and testing the functionality of Sass in the project.  
Afterward, I created the header stylesheets and applied the variables. Then, we organized the `_root` with the base structure of the project and the `_variaveis` with all the variables used in the project. Next, I modularized the files and organized them into components and abstracts. In the header component, I replaced the values with variables. We worked with `@include`, `@use`, `@extend`, and `&:nth-child` in each section."
